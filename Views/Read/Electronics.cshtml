            They refuse to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, or give a climate strategy to the 'Carbon Disclosure Project'
            They were given an 'F' in 3 of the 4 categories in Greenpeace's report 'How clean is your Cloud?'

            The world's top-selling carmaker Toyota has come joint last in a Greenpeace ranking of carbon emission
            efforts by auto firms, according to a list published Thursday during the COP26 climate summit. Toyota
            was given a F minus minus grade for decarbonisation efforts including phasing out engines that burn
            plant-warming fossil fuels in favour of electric vehicles.

            Three quarters of the planet-heating CO2 emissions Ford is responsible for come from consumers driving its cars.
            The vehicles that ford sells create 135 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to a sustainability
            report that the company released. That is almost as much as as 35 coal-fired power plants would produce in a
            year.

        <p style="width:60%">
            Hyundai-Kia was given a grade ranging from F plus to minus during the COP26 climate summit by Greenpeace.
            Across the years 2017 to 2020, the company have failed to fulfill the carbon emission regulations in China and US.
            Additionally, it only plans to transform all vehicles to net-zero carbon emissions for the markets of China, the EU and US.
            Other larger markets such as South Korea and India are not included in the carbon neutral plan.
            Due to having different standards in working towards reducing carbon emissions, it is ineffective in its effort in curbing climate change.

        <p style="width:60%">
            Tesla is arguably the most environmentally-conscious carmaker that is operating today. The company is founded
            on the principle that vehicles that run on sustainable energy can be just as fun and amazing as the best
            petrol-powered cars in the market. Sustainability is at the heart of Tesla, and this is represented by its
            zero-emissions vehicles all the way to the net-zero targets for its Gigafactories.

            Honda was the first to create and release an engine that was compliant with the strict Clean Air Act regulations.
            They were quick to share the technology with the rest of the industry. Honda is also proud to build its reputation
            around its quality vehicles and their environmental leadership. They have several projects running at many levels
            that are both beneficial to the consumer and the natural world.

        <h3>5. Renault</h3>
        <p style="width:60%">
            Renault Group was the first full-line carmaker to embrace the all-electric car. Eight years after the launch of the first ZOE,
            with more than 390,000 electric vehicles on the road, Renault Group is making a significant contribution to reducing the emissions
            of vehicles in use. Off the road, Renault Group has developed a pathway to decarbonize by reducing the carbon footprint of its
            production facilities and suppliers. Renault Group’s climate project is composed of nine main actions. They will be gradually
            rolled out across the Group until 2030, an interim milestone toward our ambition of carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.
